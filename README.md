# This contains EDA and pipeline formation for cyberbullying dataset (youtub_parserd_dataset)
## To access the pipeline go to pipeline.ipynb to test the pipeline on other dataset for "youtube_parsed_dataset".


**Test Resuts**
Logistic Regression: Achieved an accuracy of approximately 91.9% and an AUC score of about 97.1%, indicating good performance in distinguishing between cyberbullying and non-bullying instances.
XGBoost: Outperformed logistic regression with higher accuracy (~94.8%) and AUC score (~98.8%), suggesting superior predictive capabilities.
Decision Tree: Although providing acceptable performance with an accuracy of around 90.1% and an AUC score of about 90.4%, it lags behind logistic regression and XGBoost.
Overall Conclusions:
